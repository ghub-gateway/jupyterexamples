    "I have found that beginners coming from lower-level languages such as C++, Fortran, or Java often stumble when it comes to computations.  They create arrays and then loop over the arrays with nested for loops, computing the new values for each element one-by-one.  This approach works, but will result in very poor performance.  \n",
