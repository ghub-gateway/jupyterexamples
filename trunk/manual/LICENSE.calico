All of the software developed for the Institute for Personal Robots in Education is released under OSI-approved open source licenses. We encourage collaboration in the community in our endeavor to explore the use of robots in education. In this spirit, IPRE has developed a series of projects, some which rely on other open source projects.
Myro - A set of interfaces for accessing and interacting with robots. These are written in C# by researchers from Microsoft Research, Georgia Tech, and Bryn Mawr College. These are released under the Microsoft Public License and copyright is retained by their owners. Myro has optional dependencies on SDL, and eSpeak. You can find the Myro code in the Calico/modules/Myro folder.
Calico - An editor and shell environment for writing and interacting with code in a dynamic manner. It is written in C# by researchers from Microsoft Research, Georgia Tech, and Bryn Mawr College. It is released under the Microsoft Public License and copyright is retained by their owners. Calico uses Gtk, which has been released under the LGPL. You can find the Calico code in the Calico/Source folder.
Libraries and Plugins - Various libraries loaded by any of the supported languages, including Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Basic, etc. These are released under many different open source licenses. The libraries that come with CPython (and can be loaded by IronPython) are listed, along with their licenses, in the IronPython Community Edition. These are often based, derived, or depend on other open source code.
Infrastructure - All of the infrastructure is built on open and freely available standards. ECMA 334 defines the C# language, and ECMA 335 defines the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI). Microsoft has an implementation of both of these in the form of their C# compiler, and .NET Runtime. A free, but limited, C# compiler is available for Microsoft Windows from Microsoft as Visual Studio Express, and the .NET runtime is available as a free download from Microsoft. The Mono project has implementations of both of these ECMA standards; Mono's C# compiler is released under the GNU GPL, and the Mono Runtime libraries are released under the GNU LGPL. The Python License allows Python to be free for most any purpose.
Contributors should follow the rules specified by their chosen license, and should not mix licenses across library boundaries as indicated by the folder structure above.
